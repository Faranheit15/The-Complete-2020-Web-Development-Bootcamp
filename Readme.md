 <strong>This repo is for sharing the progress of my Udemy "Training".</strong>
 
 I have selected 'The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp' course. So, if you need any help with this or any other Web Development course, you can ask about it to me anytime you want to. If I am not available, feel free to post the query on this <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/DeTUWTzakOxG2dwepQGM57">WhatsApp forum</a> that I am a part of.
 
 You can find the notes on this course on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-3_P9Lf5_WeAt2zLvywBO9ALvV8WT7u45iwXQ9nIfOA/edit">this link</a>.
 
 Also, I'll be constantly updating the files on my <a href="https://github.com/Faranheit15/The-Complete-2020-Web-Development-Bootcamp">GitHub repository</a>. So, make sure to check it.
 
 Also, an essential point. The instructor in most of the courses use Sublime Text or Atom as their editor. I'd recommend you to download VSCode instead, because it's much better. Here's the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">official link</a>.
 
 <em>Good luck, and happy coding.</em>
