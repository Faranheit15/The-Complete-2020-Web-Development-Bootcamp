 So, I'll be starting my Udemy "Training" today. I'd like to encourage you to start it with me (learning a skill together is always advantageous).
 
 I have selected 'The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp' course. So, if you need any help with this or any other Web Development course, you can ask about it to me anytime you want to. If I am not available, feel free to post the query on this WhatsApp forum that I am a part of: https://chat.whatsapp.com/DeTUWTzakOxG2dwepQGM57
 
 You can find the notes on this course on this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-3_P9Lf5_WeAt2zLvywBO9ALvV8WT7u45iwXQ9nIfOA/edit
 
 Also, I'll be constantly updating the files on my GitHub repository. So, make sure to check: https://github.com/Faranheit15/The-Complete-2020-Web-Development-Bootcamp
 
 Also, an essential point. The instructor in most of the courses use Sublime Text or Atom as their editor. I'd recommend you to download VSCode instead, because it's much better. Here's the official link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
 
 Good luck, and happy coding.
